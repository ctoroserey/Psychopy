-> __init__ line 37, replace with:
	cbArray = np.array(cbArray,dtype='int')
-> wtwTask.py, line 186, insert:
	calibLevel = None
-> drop threshold to 20%. 
-> make the "hole" just an outline?



-> issues from piloting.
	*fix the bloated log file.
		- don't update time left and force meter if unchanged?
		- or just stop logging these and progress bar. 
		***set autoLog=False during creation of the offending objects. 
		***also added 'name' fields to help with log files.
	*decrease the grip threshold
		***dropped from 0.30 to 0.25
	*deal with the crash / incomplete close on exit. 
		- fixing log file issue might help?
		- or, is the LIFO queue getting too large; should periodically clear it?

-> check in pilot data:
	-> biopac marker channel timing -> compare RTs between the 2 data files.
	-> logging of practice trials. 
	-> timing, including skipped frames
	-> general logging:
		includes the timing distribution and the response function for each block
		includes grip calibration information. 
	-> run checks on the sampling of delays. 

-> analysis code:
	- visualize responses
	- check timing precision
	- be sure recorded responses times aren't locked to the grid of video frames

punch list:
	*delete unused instructions function in __init__
		***ok
	*add a "block completed" message after block 1.
		***ok
	*allow "distribs" list to have just 1 entry if it stays constant.
		***ok
	*avoid logging demo trials
		***ok
	*check & consolidate marker channel code
	*final free-choice block (sub-function)

-> implement the threading LIFO solution for the calibration block?

-> more work on the unit test for sampling delays?
	-> plot the cumulative distribution function
	-> plot the delays over time
	-> plot the autocorrelation function. 



== done ==
-> issue w/ total earnings not updating? -> fixed; needed from future import division
	(10/100 was returning 0)
-> consolidated all the handgrip-related functions into a handgrip.py submodule. 
-> calibration script should estimate the "floor" voltage (and return it). 
-> add grip force meter. 
-> enable the “cancel” button on the “handgrip missing” box to quit the exit.
-> merge the grip force functionality into the main showTrials function. 


== lower priority ==
-> for sampling functions.....
	at least for discrete functions, could initialize and store the support values
	(rather than calculating them each time a sample is drawn)
	keep in mind in case of speed/performance issues. 
-> implement "active" delay with repeated key presses
