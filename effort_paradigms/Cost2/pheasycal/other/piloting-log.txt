- acqknowledge stopped recording after 30 min (midway through 2nd block)
- psychopy completed the experiment but didn't exit properly
	-> took a long time to close the window
	-> partly closed but left open processes; required restart.

after the first 3 subjects, some edits.
	-> dropped grip threshold fraction from 0.3 to 0.25 (and made it a parameter at the top)
	-> added a post-block message ("Block 1 complete...")
	-> turned off logging for progress bar, meter needle, time left text, and calibration meter.
	-> added names when creating objects (for logging)
	-> removed unused instructions code
	-> created an alternative experiment handler to keep instruction trials out of the main data file
	-> let the timing distribution be specified just once for all blocks
